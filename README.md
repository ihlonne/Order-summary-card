## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project has been good to continue solidifying my use of flexbox. 


### Continued development

I'm not happy with the solution for this project and intend to start all over again sometime in the future. I have some iffy solutions that didn't necessarily solve my problem and I didn't understand why it worked. My problem lies with the background position, as well as the alignment between "Annual Plan / $59.99/year" and "Change".
